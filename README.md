# GTDB2EMU

Set of simple auxiliary python scripts to help create GTDB databases for annotation with EMU

<br>
This collection of scripts is designed to facillitate EMU annotations with GTDB reps ssu, or GTDB all ssu 
It consists of 2 separate small scripts, that can be run in Spyder, or reused for other purposes.

<br><br>
Running a pipeline would consist of:<br>
-1. GTDB_ssu_download.py: to download recent GTDB ssu fasta files and taxonomy metadata<br>
-2. GTDB_ssu_prep.py: to format GTDB ssu into seperate taxonomy and fasta files, with option to trim fragmented sequences below certain basepair length <br>
